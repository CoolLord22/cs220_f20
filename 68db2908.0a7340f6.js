Homework assignments are expected to take a considerable amount of time; some students report taking as much as 40 hours or more per week, so start early and budget your time well. On average, it should take at least 10 hours per week. Additionally, try to use incremental development so that even if you run out of time, you can still turn in code that implements some of the desired functionality (with a README file and comments explaining what\u2019s missing). Keep in mind that half the features working all the way get you a lot more partial credit than all the features half-way working. Good use of the version control system will significantly help with your incremental development. For each commit, you should maintain your README file to outline what\u2019s missing and what\u2019s done, and try to keep each commit a submittable version.
