Non-compiling code may earn a score of zero, so students are strongly encouraged to double-check that all submitted codes fully compile with no errors or warnings in the standard course compilation environment. There will be a 30-minute grace period after the deadline during which assignments can still be submitted, but will receive a penalty of a deduction of 10% of the points possible on the assignment. In addition, each student will be permitted to use up to 3 \u201clate days\u201d total during the semester on the individual coding assignments only. (That is, no late days are allowed for handwritten homework or partner-based coding projects.) Each delay of up to 24 hours past the 11:00 pm deadline for an individual coding assignment counts as one late day. Students may not use a grace period with a late day. For example, if Student A turns in her homework at 11:45 pm on the day it is due (only 45 minutes past the original deadline), then she will be using one late day. Furthermore, if Student B turns in his homework at 11:15 pm on the day after it is due, he\u2019ll be using two late days."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Given these policies, please plan to get your homework done and turned in early so that if you encounter any last-minute delays, it will not hurt you too badly. Additionally, Gradescope will allow multiple submission attempts; we will simply grade the last one. So it\u2019s a good idea to develop your program incrementally, and turn in a fully-compiling (if only partially complete) version every day or so. Deadline exceptions can only be made by an instructor (not TAs/CAs), and will only be considered in the circumstances outside the control of the student (e.g., serious illness, death of a relative, etc.). If you must request an exception, do so as early as possible; it is easier to get an exception if you ask before an assignment is due, rather than after. No exceptions will be given for failure to plan ahead or simply having \u201dtoo much work.\u201d"))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
