Everyone here has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. We believe fostering an inclusive climate is important because research and my experience show that students who interact with peers who are different from themselves learn new things and experience tangible educational outcomes. Please join us in creating a welcoming and vibrant classroom climate. Note that you should expect to be challenged intellectually by instructors, the course assistants (CAs), and your peers, and at times this may feel uncomfortable. Indeed, it can be helpful to be pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow. But at no time in this learning process should someone be singled out or treated unequally on the basis of any seen or unseen part of their identity."),Object(i.b)("p",null,"If you ever have concerns in this course about harassment, discrimination, or any unequal treatment, or if you seek accommodations or resources, we invite you to share directly with instructors or the CAs.
